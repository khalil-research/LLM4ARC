To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Shift all non-zero elements in each row to the leftmost column of that row.

- The first row is shifted by 1 position to the right, and a new digit ""1"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 8.
- The second row is shifted by 2 positions to the right, and a new digit ""1"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 16.
- The third row is shifted by 3 positions to the right, and a new digit ""8"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 8.
- The fourth row is not shifted, so it remains the same.
- The fifth row is shifted by 1 position to the right, and a new digit ""1"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 8.
- The sixth row is shifted by 2 positions to the right, and a new digit ""8"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 8.
- The seventh row is shifted by 3 positions to the right, and a new digit ""8"" is added in the vacated position, since the sum of the digits in the original row that were shifted is 16.","0000188

- The first digit of each row becomes the last digit of that row, and the last digit of each row becomes the first digit of that row.

So, the input grid:
6662
6162
7272
1722

Becomes the output grid:
2666
2616
2727
2271

For the second demonstration, the transformation is as follows:
- The first digit of each row becomes the last digit of that row, and the last digit of each row becomes the first digit of that row.
- The middle digit of each row becomes the digit that appears the most in that row.

So, the input grid:

2277722
7271272
6662211

6666626

For the third demonstration, the transformation is as follows:
- The first digit of each row becomes the second digit of that row, the second digit becomes the first digit, and the last digit becomes the third digit.

So, the input grid:

Now, for the test input grid:

The output grid would be:

- The top-center cell becomes 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.
- The top-right cell becomes 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10, which becomes 0.
- The middle-left cell becomes 0 + 4 + 0 + 7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 13, which becomes 3.
- The middle-center cell becomes 0 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 13, which becomes 3.
- The middle-right cell becomes 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8.
- The bottom-left cell becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.
