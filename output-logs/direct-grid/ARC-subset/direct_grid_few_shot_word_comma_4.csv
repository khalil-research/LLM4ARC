Here's the step-by-step transformation:

1. Replace all black cells that are surrounded by blue cells on their left and right with red cells.
2. Replace all black cells that are surrounded by blue cells on their top and bottom with red cells.
3. Replace all black cells that are surrounded by red cells on their left and right with red cells.
4. Replace all black cells that are surrounded by red cells on their top and bottom with red cells.","black,blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,blue

Transformation steps:

1. For each colored cell, add a cell of the same color to the right of it. If the cell to the right is already colored, skip this step for that cell.
2. For each colored cell, add a cell of the same color below it. If the cell below is already colored, skip this step for that cell.","black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black

1. Replace the inner cells of the cyan region with black cells.
2. Replace the inner cells of the purple region with black cells.
3. Replace the inner cells of the yellow region with black cells.
4. Replace the inner cells of the blue region with black cells.
5. Replace the inner cells of the green region with black cells.","black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black

Applying this rule to the test input grid:

Input grid:
blue,green,red
green,green,red
blue,green,red

Step 1:
- The second cell in the first row (green) has the same color as the cell below it (green), so change it to gray.
- The second cell in the second row (green) has the same color as the cell below it (green), so change it to gray.
- The third cell in the second row (red) has the same color as the cell below it (red), so change it to gray.

After step 1:
blue,gray,red
green,gray,gray
blue,green,red

Step 2:
- The second cell in the second row (gray) has the same color as the cell to its left (gray), so change it to gray.
- The third cell in the second row (gray) has the same color as the cell to its left (gray), so change it to gray.
